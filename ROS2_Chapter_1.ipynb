    "One typical way to solve this question is collaboration. By following the priciple of not re-designning the wheel, each party utilize their specialty to contribute a module to the design of the robot. This is the idea of ROS (Robot Operating System).

ROS2 is the latest version of ROS, which is designed to improve the performance and maintainability of ROS. ROS2 is a distributed framework for robotics focused on communication between different nodes. It is designed to be more secure, real-time, and easier to use than ROS1. ROS2 is designed to be more modular and flexible than ROS1, allowing developers to use only the parts of the framework that they need. ROS2 is also designed to be more portable than ROS1, allowing developers to run their code on a wide variety of platforms, including embedded systems and cloud-based services.\n",

    "The above example is an example of a simple ROS2 node written in Python. The node initializes the ROS 2 client library, creates a node, prints a message to the console, and then shuts down the client library. The `rclpy.init()` function initializes the ROS 2 client library, the `rclpy.create_node()` function creates a new node, the `node.get_logger().info()` function prints a message to the console, and the `rclpy.shutdown()` function releases the resources used by the client library. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run as the main program. This allows the script to be imported as a module without running the main function. \n",

    "It is an example of instantiating a Node in Python. However, in ROS2, this type of instantiation is not recommended. Instead, it is recommended to use the `Node` class provided by the `rclpy` library. The `Node` class provides a more object-oriented approach to working with nodes in ROS2. The following is an example of how to create a node using the `Node` class:\n",

    "The above example is an example of a simple ROS2 node written in Python using the `Node` class. The `MyNode` class inherits from the `Node` class provided by the `rclpy` library. The `__init__()` method of the `MyNode` class initializes the node with the name \"node_name_py\" and prints a message to the console. The `main()` function initializes the ROS 2 client library, creates an instance of the `MyNode` class, and then shuts down the client library. The `rclpy.init()` function initializes the ROS 2 client library, the `MyNode()` function creates a new instance of the `MyNode` class, and the `rclpy.shutdown()` function releases the resources used by the client library.\n",

    "The reason this type of instantiation is recommended is that it provides a more object-oriented approach to working with nodes in ROS2. By using the `Node` class, you can take advantage of the features and functionality provided by the class, such as logging, parameter management, and lifecycle management.
