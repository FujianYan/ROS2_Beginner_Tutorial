    "## 3.1 Data Distribution Se Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In ROS 2, although there are various communication methods, the components of each method are similar. For example: communication involves two or more parties, different communication objects need to be linked, each has its own model, and data exchange always requires a data carrier. This section will introduce some of the terminology involved in ROS 2 communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "In many robotics-related application scenarios, multiple ROS 2 devices work together, such as in autonomous vehicle fleets, drone swarms, and remote control operations. But how do different ROS 2 devices communicate with each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**\n",
    "Distributed communication refers to a communication strategy that enables data exchange across different hosts over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS 2 itself is a distributed communication framework, making it easy to achieve communication between different devices. ROS 2 is based on DDS (Data Distribution Service), and when devices are on the same network, distributed communication can be achieved through DDS's Domain ID mechanism (ROS_DOMAIN_ID). The basic process is as follows: before launching a node, you can set the Domain ID value. Nodes with the same Domain ID can discover and communicate with each other, while nodes with different Domain IDs cannot. By default, all nodes use Domain ID 0 when launched, meaning that as long as devices are on the same network, no additional configuration is needed for nodes on different ROS 2 devices to achieve distributed communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application**\n",
    "Distributed communication is widely applicable. As mentioned above, in robotic swarms, robots may need to obtain information about the speed, position, and trajectory of neighboring robots. In remote control scenarios, the control unit may need to access environmental information collected by the robot and send control commands. All of these data exchanges rely on distributed communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "For multi-machine communication, you can group nodes by Domain ID. Nodes within the same group can communicate freely, while nodes in different groups cannot. If all nodes belong to the same group, the default Domain ID can be used. To divide nodes into multiple groups, you can set the Domain ID of a node before launching it in the terminal (e.g., set it to 6) using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this command, the node will be assigned to the domain with ID 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a uniform Domain ID for all nodes on the current device, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=6\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "After completing this command, restart the terminal, and all nodes that are launched will automatically be assigned to the domain with ID 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "There are certain constraints when setting the value of `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is recommended to set `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` within the range [0, 101], inclusive of 0 and 101.\n",
    "- The total number of nodes within each Domain ID is limited to 120 or fewer.\n",
    "- If the Domain ID is set to 101, the total number of nodes in that domain must be 54 or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDS Domain ID Calculation Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation rules for the Domain ID values in DDS are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DDS communication is based on the TCP/IP or UDP/IP network protocols, which require specifying a port number. The port number is an unsigned 2-byte integer with a range of [0, 65535].\n",
    "- Port allocation follows specific rules and cannot be arbitrarily assigned. According to the DDS protocol, 7400 is the starting port, making the usable port range [7400, 65535]. Additionally, by default, each Domain ID uses 250 ports, so the total number of possible Domain IDs is `(65535 - 7400) / 250 = 232`, meaning the Domain ID range is [0, 231].\n",
    "- Operating systems also reserve certain ports. When using ports in DDS, these reserved ports should be avoided to prevent conflicts. Different operating systems have different reserved ports. As a result, on Linux, the usable Domain IDs are [0, 101] and [215, 231], while on Windows and macOS, the usable Domain IDs are [0, 166]. Therefore, for cross-platform compatibility, it is recommended to set Domain IDs within the range [0, 101].\n",
    "- Each Domain ID defaults to using 250 ports, and each ROS 2 node occupies two ports. According to the DDS protocol, within each Domain ID's port range, the first and second ports are the Discovery Multicast and User Multicast ports. The Discovery Unicast and User Unicast ports for the first node in the domain start at the 11th and 12th ports, respectively. Ports for subsequent nodes are assigned sequentially. Thus, the maximum number of nodes per Domain ID is `(250 - 10) / 2 = 120`.\n",
    "- Special Case: When the Domain ID is set to 101, the second half of the port range falls within the operating systemâ€™s reserved ports, limiting the maximum number of nodes to 54.\n",
    "\n",
    "These calculation rules are primarily for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Domain ID:      0\n",
    "Participant ID: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovery Multicast Port: 7400\n",
    "User Multicast Port:      7401\n",

    "## 3.2 MetaPackage \n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing a system-level feature may involve multiple packages. For example, implementing a robot navigation module could include different sub-packages for mapping, localization, path planning, etc. When a user installs this module, do they need to install each package individually?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, installing packages one by one is inefficient. In ROS 2, there is a way to bundle different packages into a single package. When installing a module, users can simply install the bundled package, known as a metapackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Metapackage** is a concept from Linux file management systems. In ROS 2, it is a \"virtual package\" that contains no actual content but depends on other packages. This allows packages to be grouped together, functioning like an index in a book, listing the sub-packages included and where to download them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the command `sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-desktop` to install ROS 2, a metapackage is used. This metapackage depends on other packages in ROS 2, so installing it will also install its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "In the previous chapter, we explored various communication mechanisms in ROS 2, understanding the implementation process, related APIs, and characteristics of each communication model. Now, we will discuss some practical issues that may arise during development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After launching a complete robot system, the setup can be quite complex, possibly consisting of dozens or even hundreds of nodes. Each node might contain one or more communication entities (such as topic publishers, topic subscribers, servers, clients, action servers, action clients, parameter servers, and parameter clients). Additionally, various message (`msg`), service (`srv`), or action interfaces are used during communication. So, how can developers easily access information about these nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters, and interfaces?\n",
    "2. When implementing communication, at least two parties are involved. Once one side is completed, how can we verify if the program functions correctly?\n",
    "3. During topic communication, a publishing frequency is set in the publisherâ€™s code. How can we verify if the actual publishing frequency matches the specified frequency during runtime?\n",

    "## 2.3 Action Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding action communication, let's start by introducing it through the use case of navigation described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A robot navigates to a specific target point. This process requires Node A to publish the target information, then Node B receives the request and controls the movement, ultimately responding with the target achievement status.*\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this seems like a task for service communication, as the requirement involves Node A sending the target, Node B executing it, and then returning a result. This is a typical request-response interaction model. However, using basic service communication alone presents a problem: navigation is a process, a time-consuming operation. If we use service communication, only at the end of the navigation would we get a response. During navigation, Node A would receive no feedback, potentially causing a \"pseudo-freeze\" in the program. This lack of control during the process can result in a poor user experience and logical flaws (such as being unable to handle navigation cancellation requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more suitable solution would be to continuously provide feedback on the robot's current state throughout the navigation process, and only return the final result when navigation completes. In ROS, this implementation strategy is known as action communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Action communication is suitable for long-running tasks. Structurally, action communication consists of three components: a goal, feedback, and a result. Functionally, it is similar to service communication, where the action client can send a request to the action server and receive the server's final response. However, action communication allows continuous feedback during the request-response process and enables the client to send a task cancellation request to the action server.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the implementation level, action communication is built on top of topic and service communication. The goal transmission is a wrapper around service communication, as is the result retrieval, while continuous feedback is a wrapper around topic communication.\n",
    " \n",
    "<div style = \"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "    <img src = \"figs/2_4_Action_Communicaiton_model_1.gif\" alt=\"Service Communication Demo\">\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, action communication is used in scenarios where a long-running task requires continuous feedback and the ability to cancel the task.\n",

    "**Scenario**\n",
    "In a robotic system, different functional modules may need to use some shared data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing navigation, path planning is required, which mainly includes global path planning and local path planning. Global path planning involves designing an approximate route from the starting point to the target point, while local path planning generates a real-time path based on the vehicleâ€™s current road conditions. Both types of path planning rely on the vehicleâ€™s dimensionsâ€”such as length, width, and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how should this common data be stored and accessed in the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the parameter server can be used. Vehicle dimension data can be stored under one node, allowing other nodes to access and manipulate this data as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter server is a communication model that facilitates data interaction between nodes in a shared manner. The node that stores parameters is called the parameter server, while nodes that retrieve parameters are called parameter clients. The interaction between the parameter client and the parameter server is request-response-based, and the implementation of parameter communication is essentially an additional layer of encapsulation over service communication.\n",
