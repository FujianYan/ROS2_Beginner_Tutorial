    "A robot is a highly complex, systematic implementation. A complete robotic application may consist of several functional modules, and each module may contain multiple functions. To operate effectively, these different modules and functions need to exchange data frequently. For instance, in the navigation system's path planning module:\n",
    "\n",
    "During path planning, data from other modules is needed as input, and the output is also provided for use by other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data includes map data provided by a mapping service, robot pose data provided by the localization module, target point data provided by the human-machine interaction module, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output path information can then be subscribed to by the motion control module or displayed on the human-machine interaction interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do these relatively independent functional modules or points exchange data with one another? To answer this, we need to introduce the communication mechanism in ROS 2.\n",

    "## 2.1 ROS2 Communication Mechanism Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In ROS 2, although there are various communication methods, the components of each method are similar. For example: communication involves two or more parties, different communication objects need to be linked, each has its own model, and data exchange always requires a data carrier. This section will introduce some of the terminology involved in ROS 2 communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Node\n",
    "\n",
    "During the communication, the basic unit of ROS 2 is the node. A node is a process that performs a specific function. For example, a node can be a sensor driver, a controller, or a planner. Nodes communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. A ROS 2 system is composed of multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages. A node can publish messages to a topic, subscribe to a topic to receive messages, or do both. Topics are used for one-to-many communication. For example, a sensor node publishes messages to a topic, and multiple nodes subscribe to the topic to receive the messages.\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Communication Models\n",
    "\n",
    "After different communication entities are linked through a topic, how is the communication actually implemented? In ROS 2, there are four commonly used communication models:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Topic Communication:** A one-way communication model where, between the two parties, the publisher sends data and the subscriber receives data. The data flow is one-directional, from the publisher to the subscriber.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Service Communication:** A request-response communication model. Here, the client sends request data to the server, and the server responds with the result back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Action Communication:** A communication model with continuous feedback. In this model, the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the final result. However, during the time between receiving the request and producing the final response, the server continuously sends feedback updates to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Parameter Service:** A shared-state communication model. Here, the server can set data, and the client can connect to the server to read or modify the server’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4 Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In ROS 2, the data exchanged between nodes is defined by an interface. An interface is a description of the data structure, including the message type, message fields, and message data. The interface is defined in a file with the extension `.msg` for messages, `.srv` for services, and `.action` for actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "# '.msg' \n",
    "int64 num1\n",
    "int64 num2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "# '.srv'\n",

    "float64 progress\n",
    "``` \n",
    "#### Data strucutre of the message, service and action interface\n",
    "It can be different types, like int, float, string, etc. The data structure of the message, service, and action interface is defined in the `.msg`, `.srv`, and `.action` files, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.5 Prepare for the exercise\n",
    "1. mkdir a new workspace named \"ws01_plumbing\"\n",

    "## 2.2 Topic Communication\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic communication is the most frequently used communication model in ROS and is based on a publish-subscribe model, where one node publishes messages, and another node subscribes to these messages. Topic communication is widely applicable in various scenarios, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*When a robot performs navigation using a LiDAR sensor, it collects data from the sensor, processes it, and generates motion control commands to drive the robot’s chassis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, topic communication is used multiple times:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LiDAR Data Collection and Processing:** In ROS, a node continuously publishes the latest data collected by the LiDAR sensor. Meanwhile, a node within the navigation module subscribes to and interprets this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publishing Motion Commands:** The navigation module calculates motion control commands by integrating multiple data sources and publishes them to the chassis control module. The chassis control node subscribes to the motion commands and converts them into pulse signals to control the motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, data from sensors like LiDAR, cameras, GPS, etc., is collected using topic communication. Topic communication is well-suited for applications requiring continuous data updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic communication is based on the publish-subscribe model. In this model, a node publishes messages to a topic, and another node subscribes to the topic to receive the messages. The publisher and subscriber nodes are decoupled, meaning they do not need to know each other’s existence. The publisher node only needs to know the topic name, and the subscriber node only needs to know the topic name and the message type.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"figs/2_2Topic_Communicaiton_model_1.gif\" alt=\"Topic Communication Model\" >\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is one-to-one relation. In ROS2, topic communication can also be one-to-many. In this case, multiple nodes can subscribe to the same topic to receive messages from the publisher node.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"figs/2_2Topic_Communicaiton_model_2.gif\" alt=\"Topic Communication Model\" >\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic communication is typically used for scenarios involving frequently updated data that require minimal logic processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About Message Interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to work with message interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Standard Data Types:** In ROS 2, the std_msgs package includes some basic native data types, such as String, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64, Char, Bool, and Empty. These native types can serve as carriers for topic communication, though they generally contain only a single data field. Since the interface files in std_msgs are relatively simple, they have limited functionality. When transmitting complex data structures, they may prove inadequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Topic Message Interfaces:** ROS 2 also provides many pre-defined standard topic message interfaces, which are widely used in practical applications. For example, the sensor_msgs package includes various sensor-related message interfaces (for LiDAR, cameras, point clouds, etc.), while the geometry_msgs package defines interfaces for geometric messages (points, coordinate frames, velocity commands, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Message Interfaces:** If the above interface files don’t meet specific needs, you can create custom message interfaces to fit those requirements.\n"

    "\n",
    "Service communication is another very porpuler communication model in ROS2. It is based on the request-response model, where one node sends a request to another node, and the latter responds with the result. Service communication is widely used in scenarios where a node needs to request data from another node, and the response is required to continue the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a robot's navigation system, the path planning module may need to request the map data from the mapping module. The path planning module sends a request to the mapping module, and the mapping module responds with the map data. The path planning module then uses this data to plan the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the previous example, the path planning module is the client, and the mapping module is the server. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the result. The client and server nodes are decoupled, meaning they do not need to know each other's existence. The client node only needs to know the service name and the service type, while the server node only needs to know the service name and the service type.\n",

    "## 2.3 Action Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding action communication, let's start by introducing it through the use case of navigation described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A robot navigates to a specific target point. This process requires Node A to publish the target information, then Node B receives the request and controls the movement, ultimately responding with the target achievement status.*\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this seems like a task for service communication, as the requirement involves Node A sending the target, Node B executing it, and then returning a result. This is a typical request-response interaction model. However, using basic service communication alone presents a problem: navigation is a process, a time-consuming operation. If we use service communication, only at the end of the navigation would we get a response. During navigation, Node A would receive no feedback, potentially causing a \"pseudo-freeze\" in the program. This lack of control during the process can result in a poor user experience and logical flaws (such as being unable to handle navigation cancellation requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more suitable solution would be to continuously provide feedback on the robot's current state throughout the navigation process, and only return the final result when navigation completes. In ROS, this implementation strategy is known as action communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Action communication is suitable for long-running tasks. Structurally, action communication consists of three components: a goal, feedback, and a result. Functionally, it is similar to service communication, where the action client can send a request to the action server and receive the server's final response. However, action communication allows continuous feedback during the request-response process and enables the client to send a task cancellation request to the action server.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the implementation level, action communication is built on top of topic and service communication. The goal transmission is a wrapper around service communication, as is the result retrieval, while continuous feedback is a wrapper around topic communication.\n",

    "## 2.4 Parameter Service\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "In a robotic system, different functional modules may need to use some shared data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing navigation, path planning is required, which mainly includes global path planning and local path planning. Global path planning involves designing an approximate route from the starting point to the target point, while local path planning generates a real-time path based on the vehicle’s current road conditions. Both types of path planning rely on the vehicle’s dimensions—such as length, width, and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how should this common data be stored and accessed in the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the parameter server can be used. Vehicle dimension data can be stored under one node, allowing other nodes to access and manipulate this data as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter server is a communication model that facilitates data interaction between nodes in a shared manner. The node that stores parameters is called the parameter server, while nodes that retrieve parameters are called parameter clients. The interaction between the parameter client and the parameter server is request-response-based, and the implementation of parameter communication is essentially an additional layer of encapsulation over service communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter communication is typically used in scenarios where shared data is required between nodes. The parameter server can store shared data, and the parameter client can access and manipulate this data as needed.\n",
